    <h3>Strategy Guide</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <b>Money Pot</b> is a game of 99% luck, but 1% skill. This means, even if you play in a strategy oblivious way, you'll
        not do so bad. But with a good enough strategy, it's actually possible to overcome the house odds, and even make
        a profit.

    </p>
    <p><b>Here's how it works:</b></p>

    <h4>Instant Crash</h4>
    <p>
        Right off the bat, there's a <b>1%</b> chance of the game instantly crashing. If this happens, no one can win anything.
        This means moneypot.com has an expected return of <code>1% * playersInGame * tableAmount</code>. This is the <b>exact amount</b>
        money pot uses to give out bonuses.
    </p>

    <h4>House Edge</h4>
    <p>
        It scales between 0 and 1% <smaal><a href="/calculator" target="_blank">see: odds and calculator.</a></smaal>
        This is what you need to overcome!
    </p>

    <h4>Bonuses</h4>
    <p>
        The last person to <b>cash out</b> before a crash gets a bonus, which on average is exactly the same as the server makes
        from the instant crash <a href="/faq#bonusfunded">see: faq</a>. Strategic play revolves completely around trying to get this bonus. If no one
        collects the bonus, it <b>rolls to the next game.</b>
    </p>

    <h4>Single Player Game</h4>
    <p>
        If you're playing a game, and no one else joins -- it's not possible to overcome the <b>house odds</b>, and it becomes
        a simple a simple game of luck.
    </p>

    <h4>Simple Greedy Strategy</h4>
    <p>
        Hold in the game, as soon as you're the last person holding, cash out immediately. This is a great strategy if
        all of your opponents are very conservative, and cash out early. However, if you play against someone with the same
        strategy -- <b>you will both will infinitely hold, and never win the bonus.</b>
