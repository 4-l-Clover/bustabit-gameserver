                <p>
                    Bitcoin gambling is a general term for any type of gambling wherein bets are placed in units of
                    bitcoin's as opposed to a fiat currency or an other assets. Learn more about
                    <a href="bitcoin-gambling">bitcoin gambling</a> or the history of <a href="online-gambling-meets-bitcoin">online gambling and bitcoin</a>.

                <p>
                    Place a bet. Watch the multiplier increase from 1x upwards! Cash out any time, to get your bet
                    multiplied by that multiplier. But be careful, the game can crash at any time -- and you'll get nothing!

                <b><a name="bits"></a>What is a bit?</b>
                <p>
                    A bit is a 1 millionth of a bitcoin, or 100 satoshis. Or approximately 0.06 US cents (at the time of writing).
                    You are able to deposit and withdraw bits at any time, by going to your account page.

                <p>
                    Every hour, you can claim 2 free bits on the account page. We do this so you may test and enjoy the game
                    without any commitment. There are no strings attached, you may withdraw this money if you so please -- but
                    we do ask you to try avoid abusing this feature =)

                <p>
                    You will need to transfer bitcoins to the add address on your account page. If you do not have any bitcoins,
                    we can recommend: <a href="https://coinbase.com">coinbase.com</a> if you are in the US (although the process
                    is quite lengthy). Another great option is <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/">localbitcoins.com</a> to find
                    someone locally willing to buy (or sell) bitcoins. You can also search online to see if there are any
                    bitcoin ATMs near you. And remember, you can directly use the bitcoin address from
                    your account page!

                    It is <strong>permanently</strong> attached to your account. You can save, store, set up for automatic
                    funding or what ever you like. All payments to this address with automatically be credited to your account.

                <b><a name="deposit-time"></a>How long for deposits to be credited to account?</b>
                <p>
                    We instantly credit accounts, upon a single confirmation. While this can take up to 40 minutes, under
                    10 minutes is far more typical.

                <b><a name="withdraw"></a>How do I withdraw bits?</b>
                <p>
                    In your account page, you can transfer bits to to any bitcoin address of your choosing. Small withdraws
                    (aka smaller than the blance of our hot-wallet) process instantly, and you will be given the transaction id.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Larger withdrawals will show in your withdraw page as "PENDING" and will require human intervention to
                    remove enough money from our cold storage. Depending on the time of day this process will normally take
                    under 2 hours, but could take up to 24 hours circumstances dependent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We remove 100 bits (about 6 US cents) from any withdrawal amount to cover mining fees. We charge this amount,
                    <strong>regardless</strong> of the actual mining fees attached to the transaction (which may be more or less
                    than this, dependant on block-competition).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Withdrawals must be in increments of 1 bit (100 satoshis), with a minimum of a 200 bit withdrawal (of which 100 bits
                    goes towards mining fee). As required, we will as well chip in with our money to help expedite confirmation time. Such
                    that we typically pay 200 bits in mining fees, despite only charging you 100 bits.

                    Gross profit refers to the sum of the profit from each game you've played without considering your loses.

                <p>
                    Upon the instant of detecting you disconnect, we cash you out (assuming the game is still in progress).
                    Regardless of if your client is connected or not, the <em>auto cashout</em> feature still works (it happens on
                    the server), and we highly recommend you use it if internet reliability or performance is a concern.

                <b><a name="high"></a>How high can the game go?</b>
                <p>
                    Very, high! Over a billion! However, if during a game we ever are facing a net loss of 200,000 bits or greater,
                    the server will automatically cash out all players still in the game, forcing them to enjoy an early win.

                <p>
                    We currently have a bet limit of 100,000 bits. If betting more than this is important to you,
                    please let us know in the support!

                <b><a name="last"></a>What is the bonus?</b>
                <p>
                    The bonus is a special prize that is awarded to the last people to cash out before the game crashes. Getting the bonus
                    is critical to skillful playing of money pot, as it is the <strong>only</strong> way to possibly overcome to house odds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The total bonus awarded each game, is equal to 1% of the sum of all players bets. This whole amount is known
                    as the <code>bonus pool</code>. Once all players bets are made, a <code>bonus multiplier</code> is created
                    which is a number that can be multiplied by a players bet to compute a suitable bonus for them.
                    The bonus multiplier is computed so that the <em>bonus pool</em> is sufficiently large to pay out
                    the largest better if he was last person to cash out. This is key to making the bonus scheme fair for all,
                    no matter how much or little bet.
                </p>
                <p> Once the game ends, we find the player(s) that cashed out last. If no one cashed out, this is everyone. If
                    multiple players cashed out at the same price point, we take these players together. We multiply their bets
                    by the <em>bonus multiplier</em> and deduct it from the <em>bonus pool</em>. If there's not enough money left in the bonus pool, all players
                    that cashed out at that same price point share the remainder according their relative bet amounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there is money left in the bonus pool, we move on to the next best cash-out point and repeats the
                    previous procedure. This continues until the bonus pool is exhausted or we have given a
                    bonus to all players who didn't cash out (which would guarantee the exhaustion of the bonus pool).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bonus is <strong>not</strong> funded by the house odds, but rather by players. Each game has 1%
                    chance of <code>instant-crashing</code>, where the game instantly crashes at the 1x multiplier. If this
                    happens, <strong>no</strong> bonuses are awarded. So in effect, the bonuses are funded directly by
                    players and you compete against them for it. All successful money pot strategies revolve around securing
                    this bonus.

            <h3>Fairness</h3>
            <dd>
                <b><a name="odds"></a>What are the game odds?</b>
                <p>
                    The house margin is scaled between 0 and 1%, depending on how long you hold. A further 1% is effectively
                    taken from every bet to put into the <a href="#bonus">bonus pool</a>, which is distributed out in its entirety
                    every game. Which means skilless play has a worst case expected return of -2%, but it is possible to overcome
                    the house margin by skillfully getting bonuses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The numbers are baked into the game, so you never need to worry about it. We do not
                    have a fixed house margin, as this would prevent highly conservative play (e.g. If you were
                    only attempting to make $2 in a $100 game, a house margin of 1% would be 50% of your potential profits!).
                    Our unique formula makes it fair for both highly conservative play (cash out early) and highly aggressive
                    play (hold till you're a millionaire). All games are <a href="#provably-fair">provably fair</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The exact formula for the houses expected return is:<br />
                    <code>1% * (intendedCashOut - roomAmount) * (roomAmount / intendedCashOut)</code><br />
                    But to really get a good sense of how this affects you, please use our handy <a href="/calculator">odds calculator</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other important thing to keep in mind, is that every game has a 1% chance of instantly crashing. We do not make
                    *any* money on it -- but rather use this to fund the bonus scheme. This is an important consideration to make if you
                    are playing in such a way that you never win the bonus.
                </p>

                <b><a name="fair"></a>Is the game fair?</b>
                <p>
                    Absolutely! And we can prove it. Before each game starts, and before a single player joins
                    we send a hash of what the result will be. The hash we display is the:
                     <code>sha256(gameCrashAmount + '|' + seed)</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And after a game ends, you can lookup the <code>gameCrashAmount</code> and the <code>seed</code>. Compute the
                    <code>sha256(gameCrashAmount + '|' + seed)</code> to verify we never changed the gameCrashAmount.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> The gameCrashAmount is an integer, which represents when it crashes as a percentage. e.g.
                    <a href="https://www.moneypot.com/game/451337">This Game</a> crashed at 16.31x with a a seed of
                    <code>e4e93da14e26c6d9a1e22f6d0e63c52d</code> so to prove we didn't cheat the has you should see on your
                    client should have seen would be: <code>25957aaf0a91ed9faaa0b4622f890a98eba174d40513cb0344ffc01a4bb55fce</code>
                    which we computed via: <code>sha256('1631|e4e93da14e26c6d9a1e22f6d0e63c52d')</code>

                <b><a name="force"></a>What happens when the server forces people to cash out?</b>
                <p>
                    Under some circumstances, the server will force people to cash out. The most common reason is that the game
                    has got high enough, that we are risking too much of our bankroll (10%). An other reason is in the event of
                    any unexpected server problems or caught errors. If more than one persons in a game is effected by the force
                    cash out, we allocate the last cash out bonus to a random player.

                <p>
                    100% offline! All deposit addresses are generated with <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">bip32</a>
                    which allows us to deterministically generate addresses that our servers do not have access to. We can monitor these addresses for funding
                    but not be able to spend them. This has the huge advantage that even if our site was compromised, attackers would not be able
                    to steal a bit!

                <p>
                    To handle instant withdraws of small amount of money, we have a <em>completely</em> separate hot wallet that
                    is not part of the sites bankroll -- and we bare all risk for. For this reason, if withdrawal amount exceeds
                    what we store in our hot wallet -- the withdrawal will be delayed while we do manually processing.
